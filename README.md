## Lets dive in!!

### Some Questions

**What is React and its purpose?**

React is a Javascript library and its ultimate purpose is to show content (HTML) to users and handle user interaction.

**Why don't we use Redux to make all the apps?**

React can work by itself. But it can also work with a tremendous variety of other libraries, packages, servers and databases.

**What is class in React**

A class that we use in React is a JavaSsript `class`. React `components` are made using *either* Javascript functions *or* classes.

**What is the HTML looking stuff in React?**

It is JSX (a special dialect of Javascript). It lools like HTML and can be placed in Javascript code. It dtermines the content of our React app just like normal HTML.

**What are two libraries Reat and ReactDOM**

React is split into two separate libraries
- `React` knows what is component is and how to make components work together
- `ReactDOM` knows how to take a component and make it show up in the DOM
